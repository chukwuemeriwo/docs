Orica turns social debates on **X (Twitter)** and **Telegram** into live wagers with instant on-chain escrow, transparent resolution, and a public leaderboard. Every wager follows a simple flow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Wager">
    Start on **X** by tagging [@oricamoney](https://twitter.com/oricamoney) in a reply to a prediction tweet, or on **Telegram** using the `/bet` command with [@oricabot](https://t.me/oricabot).

    You’ll define:

    - Asset or event (e.g., “SOL \> \$200 by tomorrow”)
    - Stake size (from \$5 up to your KYC tier limit)
    - Expiry time
    - Your side (YES / NO)

    The bot instantly generates a wager link with escrow instructions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Match the Wager">
    A counterparty has a set window (e.g., 6–24 hours) to match your stake.

    - If matched, both sides deposit into escrow, and the wager becomes **LOCKED**.
    - If unmatched, your funds are refunded automatically, minus a minimal gas fee.

    <Warning>
      If no single counterparty appears, Orica can open a pooled match. Multiple users can collectively fill the opposing side, with stakes scaled and refunds issued instantly.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sidebets for Spectators">
    Once a wager is live, a separate **Sidebets pool** opens until the cutoff.

    - Anyone can back either side.
    - Payouts are odds-based, calculated from the ratio of total stakes on each side.
    - Winners receive proportional payouts according to their risk.

    <Tip>
      Sidebets are independent of the main wager and carry their own 1% fee, with 20% flowing back to the primary winner as a bonus incentive.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Escrow & Settlement">
    All funds are locked on-chain in USDC or other SPL tokens until expiry.

    - Oracles (Chainlink, Pyth, market APIs, or custom feeds) fetch the outcome.
    - The contract automatically releases winnings to the correct side.
    - If the event is invalid or unresolved, funds are refunded.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Payouts & Leaderboards">
    Winners receive their share minus fees (1–2% on the winning pool).

    - **Primary wager winners** take the pot.
    - **Sidebettors** split their pool proportionally.
    - Results are posted to the **Live Wagers feed** and update the global leaderboard.

    <Info>
      Every win boosts your public score, so wagers aren’t just about money; they build social status.
