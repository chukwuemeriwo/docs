# How Orica Makes Money

Orica makes money by charging small, transparent fees on wagers. Every time a debate turns into a wager, it generates revenue for the protocol.  

<Note>
These fees keep the system sustainable while aligning incentives for bettors, spectators, and affiliates.
</Note>

## Primary Bets: Core Revenue  

When two users go head-to-head, Orica takes a cut from the winner’s pool.  

- **Fee:** 1–2% of the winning pool  
- **Allocation:** 100% goes to the Orica Treasury  

```mdx
Example:  
Two users stake $10,000 each. The winner receives $20,000 minus a 2% fee ($400). Orica keeps $400.

## Secondary Bets: Spectator Revenue

Spectators can place sidebets on any live wager. Orica charges a small fee on the winning pool.

* **Fee:** 1% of sidebet winnings
* **Allocation:** 80% to the Orica Treasury, 20% bonus to the primary winner

```mdx
Example:  
Sidebettors pool $50,000. The winning side collects payouts, but Orica takes a 1% fee ($500).  
$400 goes to the treasury, $100 goes to the main winner.
```

<Tip>
Primary winners are incentivized to create wagers since they also earn a cut of sidebet fees.
