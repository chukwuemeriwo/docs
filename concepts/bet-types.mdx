Orica supports three main bet types: **Primary Bets**, **Secondary Bets (Sidebets)**, and the **Counterparty Pool**. Each type serves a different purpose, but all share the same escrow, oracle, and settlement system.

## TDLR:

- **Primary Bets**: Simple head-to-head wagers.
- **Secondary Bets**: Spectator pools with odds-driven payouts.
- **Counterparty Pool**: Crowdfunded opposition for large wagers.

All three bet types make Orica flexible, fair, and engaging whether you want to go one-on-one or join in with the crowd.

## Primary Bets

Primary Bets are head-to-head wagers between two users.

- Both players deposit equal stakes into escrow.
- Stakes must be matched within the set match window (e.g., 6–24 hours).
- At settlement, the winner takes the combined pot minus a **1–2% fee** that goes to the Orica Treasury.

<Note>
  If no one matches within the deadline, the initiator’s funds are refunded automatically, minus only a minimal network fee.

## Secondary Bets (Sidebets)

Sidebets allow spectators to participate without being one of the main counterparties.

- Anyone can back either side of a live wager until the cutoff time.
- All Sidebets go into a dedicated pool separate from the main wager.
- Odds are dynamic, calculated from the ratio of total funds on each side.
- Winnings are distributed proportionally to stake size and odds.
- A **1% fee** applies to Sidebet winnings.

**Fee Allocation:**

- 80% → Orica Treasury
- 20% → Bonus for the Primary Winner

<Tip>
  This bonus incentivizes users to initiate wagers that attract spectators.

## The Counterparty Pool

When a large bet is placed and no single opponent can match it, Orica opens a Counterparty Pool.

- Multiple users can contribute smaller amounts on the opposing side.
- If the pool fully matches, the wager locks as normal.
- If partially filled, the initiator’s stake is scaled down to match and the unused amount is refunded instantly.
- Payouts are split proportionally among contributors.

<Info>
  Counterparty Pools ensure that even very large wagers find a match while keeping payouts fair for all participants.
