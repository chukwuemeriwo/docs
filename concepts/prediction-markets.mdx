Prediction markets enable people to bet on future outcomes and utilize those bets to generate real-time forecasts.

Instead of only arguing about what might happen, you can put money behind your beliefs, and the aggregated odds reveal the crowd’s expectations.

At their core, prediction markets are financial systems where **prices = probabilities**. If a market trades YES, Bitcoin \> 100K by 2025 at 0.40, it means there's a 40% chance of that outcome.

If new information comes in, the price shifts instantly as traders adjust their bets. This collective pricing process turns opinions into measurable probabilities.

## How Prediction Markets Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Market">
    Someone defines the event, for example: “Ethereum \> \$5k by December 31.”
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Liquidity">
    Participants buy YES or NO positions.  A \$1 YES share pays out \$1 if the event occurs, and \$0 otherwise. A NO share pays out if the event fails.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trading and Price Discovery">
    As people trade, the price of YES versus NO shifts. The price becomes the market’s consensus probability.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolution">
    Once the event deadline hits, a trusted **oracle** confirms the outcome. All winners are paid automatically; losers get nothing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This mechanism makes prediction markets self-correcting. Wrong beliefs lose money, accurate beliefs gain money, and the market price reflects collective knowledge.

## Why Prediction Markets Matter

Prediction markets are more than gambling tools. They are **information engines**:

- They aggregate diverse opinions into a single probability.
- They adjust instantly as new data appears.
- They reward accuracy instead of loudness.

This is why they have been used to forecast elections, sports results, economic indicators, and even company product launches.

## Traditional vs. Social Prediction Markets

Traditional prediction markets are often siloed platforms where users must sign up, deposit, and browse events. Liquidity and engagement can be low because participation requires extra effort.

Orica takes a different approach:

- Markets are created **directly inside Twitter (X) and Telegram**, where debates already happen.
- Bets are locked into **on-chain escrow** on Solana, removing counterparty risk.
- **Side bets** let spectators join any wager, with odds-based payouts.
- Public leaderboards turn predictions into social reputation, not just profit.

By embedding prediction markets into everyday conversations, Orica makes them frictionless and viral.

## Quick Example

Imagine two friends debating whether SOL will break \$250 this week.

- Alice says YES and stakes \$500.
- Bob says NO and matches with \$500.
- Their bet is locked on Solana.

Meanwhile, spectators pile into the sidebet pool, splitting odds based on how much each side attracts. If SOL ends above \$250, Alice and her backers win the pooled stakes, minus a small protocol fee. If not, Bob and his side win.

In this way, every argument becomes a live market with transparent odds and automated settlement.
