Orica applies simple and transparent fees across all wagers. These fees ensure the sustainability of the protocol while rewarding participants who drive engagement.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Primary Wagers">
    The **primary wager** is the core head-to-head between two users.

    - Fee: **1–2% of the winning pool**
    - Allocation: **100% to the Orica Treasury**

    <Note>
      Primary wager fees are applied only to the winning pool at settlement.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sidebets">
    **Side bets** let spectators participate in separate pools that run alongside the main wager.

    - Fee: **1% of sidebet winnings**
    - Allocation:
      - **80% to Orica Treasury**
      - **20% bonus to the primary wager winner**

    <Tip>
      This bonus incentivizes players to initiate wagers that attract spectator action.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refunds and Cancellations">
    If a wager is not matched within the set time window:

    - Your funds are refunded automatically.
    - Only a minimal network fee (gas) applies.

    <Check>
      No platform fees are charged on unmatched or cancelled wagers.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Future Token Revenue Share">
    When Orica launches its native token, fees will be redistributed back to the community.

    Planned allocations include:
    - **Revenue Share:** Platform fees distributed to token holders in USDC on Solana.
    - **Staking Rewards:** Token stakers earn proportional rewards, with higher yields for longer-term locks.
    - **Governance:** Token holders vote on future fee splits, affiliate incentives, and treasury allocations.

    <Info>
      This aligns the incentives of bettors, affiliates, and token holders—everyone benefits as Orica scales.
