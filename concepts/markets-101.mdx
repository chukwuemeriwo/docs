Markets on Orica are built around wagers. Every wager follows a simple lifecycle: **create, match, settle**. By understanding these three steps, you’ll know how every market works under the hood.

## Wager lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Wager">
    A user defines the terms of a wager, including the event, condition, expiry time, stake amount, and stance (YES or NO).

    - Example: “SOL \> 200 by tomorrow, 500 stake.”
    - Funds are deposited into an on-chain escrow using USDC or other Solana tokens.
    - The wager now waits for an opponent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Match with a Counterparty">
    Another user joins by taking the opposite side and depositing an equal stake within the match window.

    - If matched, the pot is locked and the wager goes live.
    - If no one matches in time, the creator’s funds are refunded (minus a minimal gas fee).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Settlement & Payout">
    When the expiry hits, an oracle checks the outcome.

    - If the creator’s side wins, they receive the pot minus protocol fees.
    - If the opponent wins, they receive the payout instead.
    - All payouts are instant and final, recorded transparently on Solana.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Sidebets and spectators

Alongside every main wager, spectators can join through **Sidebets**. They back either side with any amount, and payouts are proportional to odds based on total stakes. Sidebets keep the action open to everyone, not just the two primary bettors.

## Why this Matters

This structure makes Orica markets:

- **Trustless**: funds are locked in escrow until resolution.
- **Fair**: oracles settle results automatically, no middlemen.
- **Open**: spectators amplify liquidity and engagement.

With just three steps: create, match, settle, anyone can turn a debate into a fully transparent, on-chain market.
