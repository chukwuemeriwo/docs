##  TL;DR

If you want debates to matter, Orica is the only platform that:

- lives where you already argue,
- locks funds instantly,
- never leaves big tickets unmatched,
- gives spectators a role,
- builds your public reputation, and
- pays you to grow the network.

Everyone else gives you just a market. Orica gives you a movement.

## Native Where Debates Already Happen

On X, you tag `@oricamoney`. On Telegram, you run `/bet @oricabot`. A wager link appears instantly, escrow locks, and the bet is live. No other market lets you create wagers directly inside social apps.

## Instant Escrow and Programmatic Settlement

Once funds are deposited, they are locked on Solana until settlement. Neither side can withdraw early, and no admin can override the outcome. Oracles resolve results automatically, and payouts hit your wallet instantly.

## Counterparty Pools to Avoid Stalled Bets

If your stake is too large for one opponent, Orica opens a crowd pool on the other side. Whatever fills is matched, and the rest is refunded automatically. You always get action-sized to available liquidity.

## Sidebets for Spectators

Spectators aren’t sidelined. With Sidebets, anyone can pick a side before thecutoff, deposit, and win proportionally to their risk and contribution. This deepens liquidity and broadens engagement.

## Public Leaderboards and Reputation

Every wager is posted to a live feed with usernames, stances, and stakes. Wins update a global leaderboard tied to your social handle. You don’t just profit, you earn public status.

## Transparent, Aligned Fees

Primary wagers carry only 1–2 percent. Side bets cost 1 percent, with 20 percent of that going to the primary winner. On top of this, affiliates earn 15 percent of platform fees from their referrals.

## Built for Scale and Virality

Orica runs on Solana, capable of handling thousands of live wagers without congestion. Combined with viral loops, wager tweets, Telegram broadcasts, and leaderboard bragging, the network compounds quickly.
