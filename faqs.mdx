  <Accordion title="What is Orica?" icon="info">
    Orica turns Twitter and Telegram debates into real-money wagers on Solana. 
    Users can create head-to-head bets inside X or Telegram using bots. Stakes 
    are held in instant on-chain escrow, outcomes are settled transparently, and 
    winners climb a global leaderboard.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I start a wager?" icon="play">
    On X: Reply to a prediction tweet with bet details and tag **@oricamoney**.  
    On Telegram: Use the `/bet` command with **@oricabot**.  
    The bot replies with a wager link where you deposit your stake in USDC. Once 
    both sides fund, the wager is live.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are Sidebets?" icon="users">
    Sidebets let spectators join wagers without being the main bettors. Funds 
    go into a separate pool, and payouts are based on odds implied by total 
    stakes on each side. This makes every debate more liquid and engaging.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are winnings paid out?" icon="coins">
    Winnings are distributed instantly on Solana once the oracle posts the 
    result. Head-to-head winners take the pot minus the platform fee, while 
    sidebettors are paid proportionally according to odds.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What fees does Orica charge?" icon="percent">
    Primary wagers: **1–2% fee** from the winning pool (goes to treasury).  
    Sidebets: **1% fee** from sidebet winnings (80% to treasury, 20% bonus to the 
    main wager winner).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What tokens can I use?" icon="wallet">
    Orica currently uses **USDC and other SPL tokens** on Solana. Funds are 
    deposited via wallets like Phantom, Solflare, or Backpack.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are outcomes decided?" icon="award">
    Oracles fetch results from reliable sources like Chainlink, Pyth, CoinGecko, 
    and other APIs. Once verified, smart contracts release funds automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if no one matches my bet?" icon="clock">
    If no counterparty matches your stake within the match window, your funds 
    are refunded automatically (minus a tiny gas fee). Optionally, the system 
    can open a **B-side pool** where multiple contributors fill the other side.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is Orica trustless?" icon="shield-check">
    Yes. All wagers, escrow, and settlements are handled fully on-chain by smart 
    contracts on Solana. No admins can override results. Every action is public 
    and immutable.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why would I use Orica instead of a prediction market?" icon="trophy">
    Orica is **native inside social platforms**. You don’t need an extra app. Bets 
    happen where the debates already are. With odds-driven Sidebets, public 
    leaderboards, and instant settlement, Orica makes debates measurable, social, 
    and profitable.
