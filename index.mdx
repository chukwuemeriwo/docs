Orica Money is the first **social betting escrow** where you can turn debates on social media into real-money wagers. You can bet on anything against anyone from conversations on your social media apps (X, Telegram e.t.c).


Your bets are locked, tracked and ranked to gamify the prediction experience and make it more fun, competitive and rewarding.

Everyone has opinions and hot takes online, it's time to put your money where your mouth is, and we're bringing it to where these conversations happen. With Orica, you can challenge a friend, match a stranger, or let the crowd fill the other side of your bet.


On Orica, you can:

* **Create head-to-head bets** directly from X or Telegram.
* **Join side bets** with the wider community and stack extra liquidity.
* **Track your status** on the public leaderboard with win streaks and bragging rights.


We’ve designed Orica to be simple, fair, and transparent. Escrow smart contracts hold every wager. Oracles settle outcomes automatically. And fees stay lean: just 1–2% on primary bets, and 1% on side bets (with a bonus kickback to the primary winner).

The result? A new layer of social finance that makes online debates **trustless, viral, and rewarding**.
