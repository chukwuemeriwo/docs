Orica Money is the first **social betting escrow** service, where you can turn social media debates into real-money wagers.

You can bet on anything against anyone from conversations on your social media apps (e.g., X, Telegram).

On Orica, you can challenge a friend, match a stranger, or let the crowd fill the other side of your bet.

Everyone has opinions and hot takes online; it's time to put your money where your mouth is, and we're bringing it to where these conversations happen.

- **Create head-to-head bets** directly from X or Telegram.
- **Join side bets** with the wider community and stack extra liquidity.
- **Track your status** on the public leaderboard with win streaks and bragging rights.

We’ve designed Orica to be simple, fair, and transparent. Escrow smart contracts hold every wager. Oracles settle outcomes automatically, and fees stay lean: just 1–2% on primary bets, and 1% on side bets (with a bonus kickback to the primary winner).

<Info>
  Your bets are locked, tracked, and ranked to gamify the prediction experience, making it more fun, competitive, and rewarding.

The result? A new layer of social finance that makes online debates **trustless, viral, and rewarding**.
