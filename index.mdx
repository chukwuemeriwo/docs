Orica Money is the first **social betting escrow** service, where you can turn social media debates into real-money wagers.

Orica turns your Twitter (X) and Telegram debates into **real-money wagers** on Solana. No more endless arguing online, now you can lock in your bet, let outcomes settle automatically, and climb a global leaderboard that shows who really calls it right.

You don’t need to download anything new. Just tag **@oricamoney** on X or use **/bet** in Telegram, and the Orica bot instantly creates a wager.  Spectators can join with **Sidebets**, adding liquidity and odds-based payouts to the action.

<Note>
  Your bets are locked, tracked, and ranked to gamify the prediction experience, making it more fun, competitive, and rewarding.

Everyone has opinions and hot takes online; it's time to put your money where your mouth is, and we're bringing it to where these conversations happen.

- **Create head-to-head bets** directly from X or Telegram.
- **Join side bets** with the wider community and stack extra liquidity.
- **Track your status** on the public leaderboard with win streaks and bragging rights.

Orica already has strong community traction, with early adopters across crypto trading, sports, and prediction markets.

## What Makes Orica Unique?

- **Native in social platforms** → Wagers start directly inside X and Telegram, no separate app required.
- **Odds-based Sidebets** → Spectators join in with proportional, fair payouts.
- **Social leaderboards** → Wins build your public reputation, not just profits.
- **Built on Solana** → Low fees, instant settlement, and scalability for thousands of live wagers.

Think of it like a prediction market, but **more social**, where debates instantly bridge into financial outcomes.

We’ve designed Orica to be simple, fair, and transparent. Escrow smart contracts hold every wager. Oracles settle outcomes automatically, and fees stay lean: just 1–2% on primary bets, and 1% on side bets (with a bonus kickback to the primary winner).

The result? A new layer of social finance that makes online debates **trustless, viral, and rewarding**.
